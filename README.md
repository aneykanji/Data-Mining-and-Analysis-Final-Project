# Data-Mining-and-Analysis-Final-Project
Final Project for ECEN 758. Exploring Machine Learning Algorithms on UrbanSound8k Audio Dataset. This is Team 14's Repository

## Quick Start

The easiest way to view our final classification model is through Google Colab. The data path is automatically mounted for all viewers. Simply click the link below and run all cells to see the EDA and classification results. No additional file path mounting required. 

**[Open Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oF4z0fYNQb1F_I9lbtqXjdJsLLDmzCbX#scrollTo=HW9EO1e-qi0t)**

The notebook will load our saved CNN model and testing arrays, displaying model statistics and confusion matrices.
